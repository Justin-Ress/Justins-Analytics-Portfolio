## [Project 1: Explaining Improvement at the Elite Level of Swimming](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/justin.ress/viz/VisualsV4/Sheet32)

This is the first data project I completed, where I used data-driven insights to understand what it takes to improve in swimming at an elite level.

* I collected my own data for this project using a Python script I wrote that measures stroke rates across a race
* I ran the script for each 100 freestyle race in the A finals at the NCAA Championship from 2015-2024
* Upon the completion of the data collection, I wrote and ran different Python scripts to help aggregate and ogranize the data
* The resulting csv files were used to create compelling visuals with Tableau
* I used the visuals for a live presentation to club swimmers
