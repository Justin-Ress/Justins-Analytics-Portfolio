BM,Bobby 'Big Dog' Malone,4,4,2,10,2,1,147.3431667,9,39,5,1.5445,5,136.632,172.958,141.2113333,138.5713333,1.63,0.55,0.9666666667,3.91,3.866666667,4.133333333,3.666666667,4,5,3,5,4,"Bobby 'Big Dog' Malone is the most unpredictable rider on the roster. His poor jumping and clumsy cornering disrupt flow, and while he boasts a maxed out turbo stat, his slow heat buildup makes short bursts feel sluggish. But on fast, straight-shot courses, Bobby finally gets to stretch his legs. Surprisingly strong powersliding gives him just enough control, even though his basic turning is among the worst in the game. Despite struggling in most of the rating metrics, the Big Dog shows up more often than expected on the track leaderboards. It speaks to his pacing consistency, where he quietly ranks among the best. Master his powerslide and you might unlock his hidden potential. Bobby is the ultimate high risk, high reward pick."
NY,Nigel 'The Duke' York,2,2,6,10,4,7,146.1538333,3,47,6,5.7375,2,135.7393333,169.9413333,142.9506667,135.984,1.52,0.7,0.95,4.18,4.133333333,4.533333333,3.666666667,4.4,3,5,4,7,"Niguel 'The Duke' York ties for the lowest total base stats in the game, but don’t count him out. His strong jumping ability gives him a fighting chance on tougher tracks, helping him recover from sloppy sections and stay in the race. While his weak cornering and unstable landings make it difficult to find rhythm, once he locks in, he has record-setting potential. His powerslide is wild and hard to control, but it delivers some of the fastest and sharpest turns in the game. The Duke may be one of the hardest riders to master, but like others in his stat tier, his ceiling is sky-high."
VS,Vicky 'The Vixen' Steele,4,6,6,8,3,5,147.8433333,4,21,2,5.9745,6,135.062,174.2073333,143.998,138.106,1.75,0.5666666667,0.95,3.82,4.266666667,3.666666667,3.733333333,3.6,6,2,2,5,"Vicky 'The Vixen' Steele is a brute on the bike. Her mid-tier cornering makes her underwhelming at both smooth arcs and powerslides, and her slow turbo buildup makes quick bursts of speed hard to come by. As a result, Vicky leans on taking tight inside lines and bumping her way through the pack to stay competitive. While her strong jumping and slow heat rate offer some recovery potential, she struggles to build and maintain momentum. Unless you can bully your way to the front, it’s hard to find consistent success with The Vixen."
JR,Jumpin' Jim Rivers,6,6,6,6,5,6,146.4498333,2,61,8,8.659,4,134.3393333,170.8713333,141.5386667,139.05,1.43,0.75,0.9833333333,4.32,4.266666667,4.533333333,4.133333333,4.333333333,6,4,6,6,"Jumpin' Jim Rivers is Excitebike’s so-called all-arounder; solid on paper, but more fragile in practice. He’s best when front-running and keeping it clean, but his mid-level cornering makes him just okay at smooth turns and weak at powerslides. His turbo is equally underwhelming, lacking both strong bursts and sustained speed. These limitations force players to ride cautiously, often skipping turbo in critical moments. That constant adjustment leads to the lowest pace rating in the game as Jim has the most inconsistent lap times on the roster. Still, with sharp focus and smart heat management, he’s capable of putting together record-breaking runs."
TR,Tricky' Ricky Stern,10,8,10,2,6,9,145.3675,8,49,6,3.2405,3,132.848,168.0273333,140.362,140.2326667,1.32,0.7666666667,1,4.45,4.53,4.866666667,4.4,4,7,6,6,4,"Tricky' Ricky Stern is a recovery specialist with elite jumping, cornering, and landing, making him one of the easiest riders to race clean with. His low turbo stat allows quick bursts but also causes him to overheat quickly and lose control if triggered too early out of turns. You’ll often need to float longer than you'd like just to cool down. Still, his forgiving stat spread makes even sloppy moments manageable, giving Ricky strong consistency on technical tracks; even if his heat issues and lack of late-race burst keep his record-setting potential in check."
SH,Sarah 'Sugar' Hill,8,10,8,4,8,9,142.8423333,5,104,10,2.2805,1,132.7086667,165.4713333,138.1433333,135.046,1.17,0.8833333333,1,4.72,4.533333333,5,4.733333333,4.6,8,10,8,8,"Sarah 'Sugar' Hill is a master of flow and recovery. Her low turbo stat means she overheats quickly, which also gives her a surprisingly sharp and responsive turbo boost. She excels at regaining speed after mistakes and cruising through technical sections. With a maxed-out cornering stat, she's built for smooth turns. However, that same control makes her the worst powerslider in the game, often struggling through tight U-turns. Her flawless run through the mid-tier technical tracks with nothing but 1st-place finishes cements her as the queen of precision racing."
