Raw Data For the ExciteBike project:

This is the foundational dataset used to build all further analysis.

Each row captures a single race performance and includes:
- Rider name  
- Run number (1–3)  
- Cup and course number  
- Individual lap times and total race time  
- Crash count, bad landings, and overheat info  
- Rider interference occurrences  
- Final placement and qualitative race notes

> 🔍 **Note:** The `Records` column was dropped in later analysis as it unfairly favored riders who appeared earlier in the race order.

This dataset was collected manually and is the basis for all scoring metrics, performance ratings, and Tableau visualizations used in the project.
