# Raw Data

Original input files used for analysis and model training.
Includes:
- Historical NCAA tournament matchups
- Team season stats
- Seedings and conference data
- Historical Conference tournament matchups

These files were provided by kaggle and I pulled data from them using SQL in order to start training my model.
